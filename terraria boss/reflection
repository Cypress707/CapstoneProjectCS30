The plan of the game changed a lot from when i first had the idea, to the point of completing the game.
The idea at first was to have a class system where you could choose from three fighters to fight an enemy knight, but because i couldm't find a good enough sprite online
i changed it to goku fighting Z broly, with a difficulty system instead of classes.
it also changed to be more of a survival game, rather than a boss battle sense the goal now is just to see how long you can make it, not beat the enemy.
